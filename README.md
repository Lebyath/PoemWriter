# PoemWriter
This is my very first, super simplistic program that writes a poem that is spaced at 20 characters per line into a .txt file.
I will be developing this as I go. I am trying to get ahead in my C# programming class and using a lot of research to help build this.
This is all a beginner learning experience for me but I can catch on pretty fast.
I hope this is something fun for others as well!

Below is a rough sketch of how to run this program in the PowerShell console and diplay you poem to the console.
